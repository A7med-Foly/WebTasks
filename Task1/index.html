                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" target="_blank">Spain</a>, a land where history is
                    seen through
                    cobblestone streets, where the aroma of paella
                    dances in the air, and where the warmth of its people embraces visitors like old friends. A
                    journey to Spain is a trip through centuries of culture, art, and tradition.
                </p>
                <p>Everything about spain is just warming. The people there are treating tourists very well, the
                    weather is stunning and it’s simply a perfect destination for summer (but not only summer). Here
                    are the most visited places in Spain:</p>
                <p>With so many places to visit and things to do such as exploring, popular destinations, amazing
                    attractions, charming beaches, historic sites, and fascinating museums in Spain, we thought it
                    would be a great idea to list the best 80 attractions to visit all in one place.

                <h2>Alhambra Palace Granada</h2>
                <p>If there is one place you should visit in Spain, it should be the Alhambra Palace in Granada.
                    Situated in a privileged position overlooking the beautiful city of <a
                        href="https://spainguides.com/top-destinations/granada-holidays/" target="_blank">Granada in
                        Andalucia</a> ,
                    the
                    Alhambra is a sprawling complex of immense beauty.
                    First mentioned in the year 899 as a small fortress, <a
                        href="https://spainguides.com/top-destinations/granada-holidays/" target="_blank">the
                        Alhambra</a> was
                    rebuilt in the
                    mid-eleventh century and then transformed from a fortress into a palace after being used as a
                    “medina”, with the addition of more and more buildings.
                    Top attractions within the Alhambra Palace to visit include the Lions Patio, the Royal Manor and
                    the exquisite Alcazaba.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Alhambra is still one of the best tourist attractions in Spain, so it's important to book
                    your entrance tickets in advance as there can be long queues at the ticket office depending on
                    the time of year.
                    The Alhambra is open Monday to Sunday from 8 am to 8 pm with extra evening visits Tuesdays and
                    Saturdays from 10 pm to 11.30 pm. Entrance fees vary depending on the area of the palace and
                    grounds you wish to visit and the type of tour, prices range from €7.00 to €16.95

                <h2>The Great Mosque of Cordoba</h2>
                <p>
                    The Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba (World Heritage Site since 1984) is arguably the most significant
                    monument in the whole of the western Moslem World and one of the most amazing buildings in the world
                    in its own right. The complete evolution of the Omeyan style in Spain can be seen in its different
                    sections, as well as the Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque styles of the Christian part.

                    The site which the <a href="https://spainguides.com/mezquita-mosque-cathedral-cordoba/"
                        target="_blank">Mosque-Cathedral</a> occupies has been used for the worship of different
                    divinities
                    since ancient times. Under the rule of the Visigoths, the Basilica of San Vicente occupied this very
                    site, and later, after the Moslems bought part of the plot of land, a primitive Mosque was built.
                    <br><br>The basilica was rectangular in shape, and for a while was shared by Christians and Moslems.
                    As the
                    Moslem population increased, the ruler Abderraman I acquired the whole site and demolished the
                    basilica to make way for the first Alhama (main) Mosque in the city. Some of the original building
                    materials from the Visigothic basilica can still be seen in the first section of the Mosque built by
                    Abderraman I.

                    The great Mosque is made up of two distinct areas, the courtyard or sahn, with its porticos (the
                    only part built by Abd al- Rahman III), where the minaret stands - nowadays, encased in the
                    Renaissance tower - and the prayer hall, or haram. The area inside is made up of a forest of columns
                    with a harmonious colour scheme of red and white arches. The five separate areas of the Mosque
                    correspond to each of the five extensions carried out.
