                    <h2>Alhambra Palace Granada</h2>
                    <p>If there is one place you should visit in Spain, it should be the Alhambra Palace in Granada.
                        Situated in a privileged position overlooking the beautiful city of <a

                            Andalucia</a> ,
                        the
                        Alhambra is a sprawling complex of immense beauty.

                        First mentioned in the year 899 as a small fortress, <a
                            href="https://spainguides.com/top-destinations/granada-holidays/" target="_blank">the
                            Alhambra</a> was
                        rebuilt in the
                        mid-eleventh century and then transformed from a fortress into a palace after being used as a
                        “medina”, with the addition of more and more buildings.

                        Top attractions within the Alhambra Palace to visit include the Lions Patio, the Royal Manor and

                        The Alhambra is still one of the best tourist attractions in Spain, so it's important to book
                        your entrance tickets in advance as there can be long queues at the ticket office depending on
                        the time of year.

                        The Alhambra is open Monday to Sunday from 8 am to 8 pm with extra evening visits Tuesdays and
                        Saturdays from 10 pm to 11.30 pm. Entrance fees vary depending on the area of the palace and
